              My hobby is painting pictures when I am getting extremely bored.I like drawing,shading painting,coloring s lot and if I am sitting bored on a place I end upt not noticing but drawing something.I am good at drawing since when I was a kid it was only hobby and the practice made me a lot better.Now I don't do drawing so much but it is still one of my favourite hobbies.It has many benefits such as increasing your observation skills while you are copying and drawing,increasing your creativity and imagination,giving you a way to impress other people and also might make an good carrear in the future.Drawing and painting a picture takes time and thus keeps us occupied and busy when we have nothing to do.</h2>
